# Student Marks Management System (Python)

## Overview
This is a simple Python-based file handling project that allows updating student marks stored in a text file.  
The program reads student data, searches by student ID, updates marks, and saves the changes back to the file.

This project is suitable for beginners learning Python file operations.

## Data Format (40 of us.txt)
Each line in the file follows this format:

StudentID, StudentName, Marks

Example:
2024200000324, Bayazid, 300  
2024200000331, Samia, 400  
2024200000360, Pritam, 370  

## Features
- Read student records from a text file  
- Search student using Student ID  
- Update student marks  
- Save updated data to the file  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- File Handling  
- Lists and Strings  

## How to Run
1. Install Python on your system.
2. Keep `40 of us.txt` in the same folder as the Python file.
3. Run the program:
   python marks_update.py
4. Enter student ID and updated marks.
